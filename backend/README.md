# BitChord — Listen Together

The party server behind **Listen together**: create a six-character code, share
it, and up to five signed-in devices listen to the same thing at the same time.
Anyone in the party can control the music.

FastAPI + a WebSocket per device, no database, deployed as a single Render web
service.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
pytest
```

## How devices stay in time

This is the part worth reading before changing anything. Nothing here is
synchronised by broadcasting "play now" — a frame that arrives 40 ms late on one
phone and 300 ms late on another would start them a quarter of a second apart,
and re-sending it more often would not fix that, only re-spread it.

Instead the server holds **a position and the server time that position was true
at**:

```jsonc
{
  "positionMs": 42000,          // where the party was...
  "anchorMs": 1757630001234,    // ...at this instant on the server's clock
  "isPlaying": true
}
```

Each device knows its own offset from that clock, so it can answer "where should
I be *right now*" locally, whenever it likes, without another round trip:

```
serverNow   = deviceNow + clockOffset
playhead    = positionMs + max(0, serverNow - anchorMs)      // while playing
playhead    = positionMs                                      // while paused
```

A delayed frame carries an anchor that is correspondingly further in the past,
so it still lands the device in exactly the right place. That is the whole
trick, and four things protect it:

1. **The clock offset is measured, not assumed.** Each device sends
   `{"type":"ping","clientMs":…}`; the server replies with that stamp untouched
   plus its own. Offset is `serverMs - (t0 + t1) / 2`, error is bounded by half
   the round trip, and keeping the sample with the *smallest* round trip is what
   makes this accurate over mobile data. Same idea as NTP. `GET /api/time` gives
   a client a first estimate before it has a socket.
2. **The server clock never jumps.** `app/clock.py` reads the wall clock once
   and advances it monotonically after that, so an NTP step on the host cannot
   rewrite the anchor under a room full of phones at once.
3. **Resuming is scheduled slightly ahead.** Play and seek anchor
   `JAM_PLAY_LEAD_MS` (default 350 ms) into the future, so every device aims at
   one common instant and has time to buffer, instead of each starting whenever
   its own packet landed. Before that instant, `position_at` holds at the
   position rather than running backwards.
4. **The truth is re-stated on a timer.** Every `JAM_STATE_HEARTBEAT_MS`
   (default 5 s) each party is told again where it is, unprompted. Lost frames,
   a phone coming back from doze, an offset that has wandered — none of those
   announce themselves, so correctness must not depend on anyone asking.

The server's state is the truth. Devices *report* their real playhead
(`{"type":"report"}`), but that is only logged — a party is never averaged
towards a straggler on a bad connection.

## Identity, and what it is worth

Creating or joining requires `userId`, `deviceId` and `displayName`, which the
app takes from the signed-in Google/YouTube profile. That is what puts real
names and avatars in the member list on every device.

**The server cannot verify that claim**, and is written on the assumption it
never will: it holds no Google credential, and an Innertube round trip per join
would be both slow and another way to get rate-limited. What *is* server-held is
the **token** minted on join — unguessable, returned exactly once, and required
on every call afterwards. So a member can lie about who they are; they cannot
act as a member they are not, or join a party whose code they were not given.

If that trade ever stops being acceptable, the place to change it is
`Party.join`: have the client send a short-lived proof from the account layer and
verify it there. Nothing above that function would need to move.

## Capacity and lifecycle

- **Five devices** (`JAM_MAX_MEMBERS`), counted per device rather than per
  account — the same person on a phone and a tablet is two streams.
- **Rejoining reclaims a slot.** Reinstall, force-stop, a socket the grace
  period outlived: all come back through the same path, so a party of five does
  not fill with ghosts of the same five devices.
- **A dropped socket is not a departure.** The membership survives
  `JAM_DISCONNECT_GRACE_MS` (default 45 s), which is what makes a tunnel or a
  screen-off invisible to everyone else.
- **The host is not privileged.** Anyone may control the music; the role only
  decides who inherits it, and it passes on when the host leaves rather than
  ending the party.
- Parties are swept when nobody has been connected for
  `JAM_EMPTY_PARTY_TTL_MS`, and unconditionally after `JAM_PARTY_MAX_AGE_MS`.

## API

All bodies and frames are camelCase — the only client is the Android app, and
matching Kotlin's naming keeps `@SerialName` off every field.

### REST

| | |
|---|---|
| `GET /healthz` | Render's health check. |
| `GET /api/time` | `{"serverMs":…}` — a clock sample before the socket exists. |
| `POST /api/parties` | Create a party and join it as host. Body: `userId`, `deviceId`, `displayName`, `avatarUrl?`. → `201` with `code`, `token`, `you`, `party`. |
| `POST /api/parties/{code}/join` | Same body. `404` unknown code, `409` full, `422` no identity. The code is normalised first, so lower case, spaces, and `O`/`I`/`L` typed for `0`/`1` all work. |
| `GET /api/parties/{code}` | Full snapshot. Needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. |
| `POST /api/parties/{code}/leave` | Give up the slot. Needs the bearer token. |

### WebSocket — `/ws/parties/{code}?token=…`

Client → server:

```jsonc
{"type": "ping",    "clientMs": 1757630000000}
{"type": "sync"}                                   // re-send me the state
{"type": "syncQueue"}                              // my queue copy is stale
{"type": "report",  "positionMs": 42210, "isPlaying": true}
{"type": "control", "action": "play",     "positionMs": 42000}
{"type": "control", "action": "pause",    "positionMs": 42000}   // positionMs optional
{"type": "control", "action": "seek",     "positionMs": 90000}   // required
{"type": "control", "action": "setTrack", "track": {…}, "positionMs": 0, "isPlaying": true}
{"type": "control", "action": "setQueue", "queue": [{…}], "queueIndex": 0}
{"type": "control", "action": "next"}
{"type": "control", "action": "previous"}
```

A `track` is `{videoId, title, artist, thumbnailUrl, durationMs}` — enough to
identify and to *show* a song, and nothing more. Stream URLs, sources, quality
and download state stay each device's own business, so two people in a party can
be on different sources at different bitrates and still be in the same place.

Server → client:

```jsonc
{"type": "welcome", "you": {…}, "party": {…}, "serverMs": …}
{"type": "pong",    "clientMs": …, "serverMs": …}
{"type": "state",   "playback": {…}, "serverMs": …}
{"type": "queue",   "queue": {"seq": 3, "index": 1, "items": [{…}]}, "serverMs": …}
{"type": "members", "members": [{…}], "maxMembers": 5, "serverMs": …}
{"type": "error",   "error": "rate_limited", "message": "…"}
{"type": "bye",     "reason": "left"}
```

Every mutation bumps `playback.seq`. **Clients must ignore any state whose `seq`
is not greater than the last one they applied** — that is what makes two people
hitting pause at the same moment settle instead of oscillate. A control is
broadcast to the sender too, so the controlling device re-anchors off the same
frame as everyone else rather than running on a state it predicted locally.

### The queue travels separately

**`state` does not contain the queue.** It carries `queueSeq`, `queueIndex` and
`queueLength`, and that is all. The list itself arrives:

- **whole, in a snapshot** — `welcome` and `GET /api/parties/{code}` both carry
  `party.queue`, because a device that has just arrived has no other way to
  learn it;
- **on change** — a `setQueue` control broadcasts a `queue` frame *before* the
  `state` frame, so nobody ever holds a state pointing at an index in a list
  they have not been given;
- **on request** — a client whose `queue.seq` disagrees with the `queueSeq` in a
  state frame sends `syncQueue`. That is the self-healing half: a missed queue
  broadcast is noticed on the very next heartbeat rather than lived with.

This split is the single biggest thing keeping the service cheap. The state
frame goes to every device every few seconds forever, and the queue is the one
field in it that is both large and almost never different — a 50-track queue on
the heartbeat was roughly twenty times the bytes of everything else combined,
paid continuously, on other people's mobile data. Adding a field to `to_wire`
that grows with the queue puts all of that straight back; put it in
`queue_to_wire` instead.

## Deploying to Render

The blueprint is `render.yaml`, but Render reads blueprints from the repository
root and this one lives in `backend/`. Either copy it up a level, or create the
service by hand — which is one screen:

- **New → Web Service**, connect this repo
- **Root Directory** `backend`
- **Runtime** Python 3
- **Build** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start** `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --ws websockets`
- **Health check path** `/healthz`
- **Instances** 1

Then point the app at `https://<service>.onrender.com`, by adding this to
`local.properties` at the repository root:

```properties
LISTEN_TOGETHER_SERVER=https://<service>.onrender.com
```

That becomes `BuildConfig.LISTEN_TOGETHER_SERVER` and seeds the address box on
the Listen Together screen. It is only a default — anything typed into that box
wins and persists, so running your own copy of this server never means editing
the build. `local.properties` is gitignored, so a fresh checkout builds with an
empty default and simply asks for an address the first time the screen is
opened.

Two things about Render specifically:

- **Keep it to one instance.** A party lives in the memory of the instance
  holding its WebSockets, so a second instance is a second, disjoint set of
  parties, and a join lands in whichever one the load balancer picked. Outgrowing
  that is a Redis pub/sub swap behind `PartyStore` — nothing above it moves.
- **The free plan spins down after ~15 minutes idle**, which closes every
  WebSocket and drops every party, and the next request then waits ~30 s for a
  cold start. Fine for development; for real use this wants the paid instance
  type, where the process stays up.

### Environment

Every one of these is optional — `app/config.py` carries the same defaults.

| Variable | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `JAM_MAX_MEMBERS` | `5` | Devices per party. |
| `JAM_STATE_HEARTBEAT_MS` | `5000` | How often the truth is re-stated. |
| `JAM_PLAY_LEAD_MS` | `350` | How far ahead a resume is scheduled. |
| `JAM_DISCONNECT_GRACE_MS` | `45000` | How long a lost socket keeps its slot. |
| `JAM_EMPTY_PARTY_TTL_MS` | `120000` | How long an empty party survives. |
| `JAM_PARTY_MAX_AGE_MS` | `43200000` | Hard ceiling on a party's life. |
| `JAM_CONTROL_RATE_PER_SECOND` | `25` | Per-member control ceiling. |
| `JAM_MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH` | `500` | Longest queue the server will hold. |
| `JAM_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | *(none)* | CORS, if a browser client ever exists. |
